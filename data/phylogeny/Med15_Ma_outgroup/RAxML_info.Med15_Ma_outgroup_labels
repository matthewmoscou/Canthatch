RAxML Bipartition Computation: Drawing support values from trees in file allBootstraps onto tree in file RAxML_result.Med15_Ma_outgroup


RAxML was called as follows:

raxml -f b -z allBootstraps -t RAxML_result.Med15_Ma_outgroup -m GTRCAT -n Med15_Ma_outgroup_labels 




Found 1 tree in File RAxML_result.Med15_Ma_outgroup



Found 1000 trees in File allBootstraps



Found 1 tree in File RAxML_result.Med15_Ma_outgroup
